**Student Performance Analysis – Power BI Dashboard**
**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance using Power BI.
The goal is to provide meaningful insights into student results, grades, attendance, and study behavior through interactive dashboards that support data-driven decision-making.

The dashboard is designed in three structured pages, moving from high-level KPIs to detailed analysis and behavioral impact.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset contains student-level information including:

Student ID

Internal Test scores

Final Exam marks

Total marks & percentage

Attendance percentage

Daily study hours

Grade and result (Pass/Fail)

**Dashboard Structure**
Page 1: Executive Summary

Total number of students

Average percentage and attendance

Overall pass percentage

Student distribution by grade

Pass vs Fail comparison

Grade-based filtering for quick insights

**Purpose**: Provide a high-level academic performance overview for decision-makers.

Page 2: Academic Performance Analysis

Average percentage by grade

Comparison of internal tests and final exam performance

Detailed student performance table with conditional formatting

Result-based filtering (Pass/Fail)

**Purpose**: Analyze how students perform across grades and assessments.

Page 3: Attendance & Study Behavior Analysis

Relationship between attendance and final exam marks

Impact of daily study hours on average percentage

Identification of at-risk students (low attendance or failed)

Interactive filters for grade and result

**Purpose**: Understand behavioral factors influencing academic outcomes.

**Tools & Techniques Used**

Power BI Desktop

DAX measures for KPIs and percentages

Data modeling & calculated fields

Interactive visuals (cards, bar charts, scatter plots, line charts)

Slicers and filters for interactivity

**Key Insights**

Higher attendance and study hours show a strong positive correlation with student performance.

Students with consistent internal test scores tend to perform better in final exams.

At-risk students can be easily identified using attendance and result analysis.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the use of Power BI for educational data analysis, focusing on clarity, interactivity, and actionable insights.
It highlights skills in data visualization, DAX, and analytical thinking, making it suitable for academic submission, internships, and entry-level data roles.
